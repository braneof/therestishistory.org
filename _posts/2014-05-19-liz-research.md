In 1977, Liz had a new baby boy and the prospects of a promising career, launched by a
recent appointment as assistant professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School. But
family considerations necessitated a move from Boston to Salt Lake City, where Liz
joined the staffs of LDS Hospital and the University of Utah Medical School. It was a
difficult move.

Feeling depressed, isolated, and longing to return to Boston, she sought the advice of her Harvard mentor and friend, Dr. Harold Dvorak. Dr. Dvorak traveled to Salt Lake City for a site visit, a visit that, as described here, would profoundly reroute Lizâ€™s life and her work.
